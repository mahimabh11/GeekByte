# GeekByte
I have developed my app “GeekByte” using Android API 29(Java) and used the emulator: Pixel 2 XL API 29 for development and testing.
The first time a user opens the app after installation, a welcome dialog pops up following which they are required to fill all fields in the order- name, phone, email and bio. The fields ‘First Name’, ‘Phone number’, ‘Email’ and ‘Bio’ are marked compulsory. The phone number field has a regex to ensure only numbers are entered along with ‘+’ , ‘-‘ ,’(‘ and ‘)’. A regex for email address has also been employed and the bio field has been set to maximum length of 250 characters. To store the last entered details of the user, I have user the ‘Shared Preferences’ local storage feature.
The number of hours given to the project is 16 hours, split over 4 days.
